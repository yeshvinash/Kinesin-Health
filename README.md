## Project Management

We are capturing project tasks on the repo project board at the following url

https://github.com/users/kinesins/projects/3

Can you please update with status when you work on and complete the tasks

## Standards

Web project must support

- Components
- Tests
- Internationalisation (English and Hindi)
- Mobile support (Work on IPhone, IPad and Desktops)
- Full modern browser support required
- Security with JWT

## Security

Security will be done by accessing our auth server and it will return

- access token on JWT
- refresh token

JWT access token will expire after 1 hour and will need to be refreshed using the refresh token

### Sample Access Token

Here is the same structure of the access token

```
{
  "role": "USER",
  "permissions": [],
  "name": "peter king",
  "verified": false,
  "id": 1,
  "tenant": 0,
  "sub": "noel@oxfordventures.org",
  "iat": 1681805249,
  "exp": 1681805249
}
```

### Sample Refresh Token

Here is the same structure of the refresh token

```
{
  "sub": "noel@oxfordventures.org",
  "iat": 1681805249,
  "exp": 1681805249
}
```

## API Defitions

API details for auth service are at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/NOEL_3/auth-service/v1.1

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
